# E-Music-Store
E-Music Store website, where people can browse music product, make an order, purchase the music.

1. Developed a Online Music Store website in java from scratch using Spring Framework.
2. Built a complex customer-order-cart-commodity domain model, using Spring Data to integrate with Hibernate and JPA to persist model data into H2 database; REST service API is developed for customer shopping and AngularJS is responsible for consuming the service.
3. Using Spring Security to intercept sensitive url request and validate user credentials from information stored in database. Content update and image upload is validated and only given access to administrator.
4. Implemented flow-oriented web process for customer checkout, including customer information collection, order confirmation, checkout status, configuring Spring Webflow to put view pages and business logic together.
